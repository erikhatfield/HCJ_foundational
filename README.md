# HCJ_foundational

## Foundational code for the web page. HTML, CSS, Javascript

### What the project does
This project is a starter kit for initializing a web page coding project. Starting with the foundation building blocks:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript (with jQuery)

### Why the project is useful
This project has three intended goals:
1. Serve as a most basic example of my codes.
2. Formalize and extend my source control (GIT) practice.
3. Collaborate with and mentor @jessemcbrower on all things interwebs development.

### How users can get started with the project
Add HTML, CSS, or Javascript to learn more about best practices of the standard HTML document and it's rendering in a browser.
